In an era when the transfer of data is happening every second as we speak, computer networking becomes an important subject of study. It is a subject that every good programmer must be thoroughly familiar with. One important topic under this is socket programming. In this article, we will discuss the topic of socket programming and study various ways of its implementation in C++.
